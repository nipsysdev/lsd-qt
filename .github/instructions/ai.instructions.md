## Before You Start: Read the Knowledge Base

**Critical first step**: Before working on any task in this project, you absolutely must scan the `.ai` folder to understand the codebase context.

Use semantic search or file search to explore what's in the `.ai` directory - there's project-specific knowledge, patterns, and conventions that you need to know about. Don't skip this step because... well, you'll probably make assumptions that don't match how this project actually works.

The knowledge base might have stuff like:

- How components are structured
- Naming conventions we use
- Common patterns and utilities
- Project-specific gotchas
